# Investigation Log

## Data Gathering

-   2021-06-14

    -   We can probably reasonably get all bills inHouse and Senate through
        automated means now. We can also get their history (including dates)
        across the two houses and what eventually becomes RA.

    -   The PDF links that are included also are searchable with full text, so
        doing some text analysis might also be useful.
