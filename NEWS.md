# phlegis (development version)

-   We can probably reasonably get all bills inHouse and Senate through
    automated means now. We can also get their history (including dates) across
    the two houses and what eventually becomes RA.

-   The PDF links that are included also are searchable with full text, so doing
    some text analysis might also be useful.

-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
